# DesktopAutoPilotX: 

Looking for a free, open-source alternative to Claude's "Computer Use"? DesktopAutoPilotX brings the power of local AI automation to your computer, without the need for API keys or cloud services.

## Why This Matters

Today's businesses are looking for ways to automate repetitive tasks, but most solutions either require expensive subscriptions or lack true AI capabilities. DesktopAutoPilotX bridges this gap by providing a local, intelligent automation system that's both powerful and accessible. Think of it as your personal automation assistant that can see, understand, and interact with your computer just like a human would.

## What Makes It Special?

- ü§ñ **AI That Understands Your Screen**: Using LLaVA for vision and Llama 2 for reasoning, it's like having a smart assistant who can actually see your screen
- üéØ **Precise & Intelligent**: No more pixel-perfect coordinates - it finds and interacts with UI elements just like you would
- üìä **Never Misses a Beat**: Keeps detailed logs of what it did and why, so you're always in the loop
- üîç **Watch It Work**: See exactly what it's doing in real-time, perfect for building trust in automation
- üß† **Thinks Before It Acts**: Breaks down complex tasks into simple steps, just like a human would

## Getting Started Is Easy

First, make sure you have these basics covered:
- Python 3.11+

## Making It Your Own

### Working with Models

We support three ways to bring AI into your automation:

1. **Ollama Provider**: Perfect for running everything locally
2. **Local Model Provider**: Want to use your own models? No problem!
3. **API Provider**: Need to connect to external AI services? We've got you covered

### Adding Your Own Models

Creating a new model configuration is straightforward. Just add a JSON file in `config/models/`:

```json
{
    "provider": "ollama|local|api",
    "model": "model_name",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "description": "What makes your model special",
    "capabilities": ["text", "vision"]
    // Provider-specific settings here
}
```

### Example Configurations

1. **Ollama LLaVA Configuration**
```json
{
    "provider": "ollama",
    "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
    "model": "llava",
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "num_predict": 1000,
    "description": "Vision-language model for UI element detection",
    "capabilities": ["vision", "text"]
}
```

2. **Local Model Configuration**
```json
{
    "provider": "local",
    "model_path": "/path/to/model",
    "model": "custom_model",
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "description": "Custom local model",
    "capabilities": ["text"]
}
```

3. **API Model Configuration**
```json
{
    "provider": "api",
    "api_url": "https://api.example.com/v1/generate",
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "description": "External API model",
    "capabilities": ["text"]
}
```
